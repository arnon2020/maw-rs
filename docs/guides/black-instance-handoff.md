## 1. Gating traps on the black machine (these cost real time)

**The local test suite has a false-red cluster (#688).** `cargo test --workspace`
on black fails ~10–11 `maw-cli` lib tests that are **green in CI**. They are
non-hermetic — they read the real repo name and real state dirs, so the fixture
`m5:atlas` comes back as `m5:maw-rs` (the checkout dir), `track` as `81-track`,
etc. The failing set: `attach_auto_picks_single_live_session…`,
`inbox_pending_*` (5), `locate_typed_inventory_routes…`, `send_acl_hotpath_*` (3).
- **The count wobbles 11↔10 between runs** — proof they're order-dependent, not
  deterministic.
- **Rule:** a change is regression-free iff it adds **no new** failures beyond
  this known set. Prove it by `git stash`-comparing (run the suspects on clean
  alpha), never by "the suite is red." alpha CI green + stash-compare clean =
  ship. Do **not** treat local full-suite red as a merge blocker on its own.

**The shipped Linux binary is musl; debug is glibc.** musl has no nss-mdns, so the
release binary **cannot resolve `.local`**; a debug build can. A fix "verified" on
debug can be dead in the shipped artifact. `curl` is glibc and resolves `.local`
even on black, so `curl` proving a hostname works proves nothing about the musl
binary. Point Linux peers at IPs / WireGuard, not `.local`.

**`rtk` mangles piped `ps`/`ls`/`wc` output** — it rewrites the stream and you can
read "0 processes" for a live build, or a header row where a path should be. Use
`rtk proxy <cmd>` or a dedicated tool when parsing output; don't trust a piped
`ps | wc` through the hook.

**`cargo clippy … | grep -E 'warning:|error'; echo $?` reports GREP's exit, not
clippy's.** grep exits 1 when it finds nothing → looks like a clippy failure when
clippy actually passed clean. Check the `Finished` line, or run clippy without the
pipe, before concluding.

**One gate per `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.** Concurrent gates on a shared target dir
cross-contaminate at test-execution time and produce phantom `FAILED` from the
other tree. Serialize.

**Local gate ≠ CI gate.** The CLAUDE.md "quick" gate omits `cargo fmt --all
--check` **and** `--features wasm-host`. Run all four dimensions (fmt / test /
clippy / wasm-host, on stable) before claiming CI-safe. Per Nat, the **local gate
is the merge decision**; CI only guards — never wait on CI in the dev loop.

**git footguns seen this week.** `git add -- A B` where `B` matches nothing stages
**neither** (broke alpha once). A stacked PR whose base is declared `alpha` shows
the parent branch's commits in its diff and the merge button does the wrong thing —
retarget the base to the parent branch until the parent merges (#692), or the diff
lies.

## 2. Why the PRs are the way they are (the diff won't tell you)

**#687 (oracle "mawjs" masquerade).** Two independent constants fabricated
`oracle:"mawjs"` for every maw-rs node: `/api/identity` emit and the peer-store
parser. **All three display sites were already honest** (`unwrap_or("-")`,
`filter(!empty)→None`, `p.oracle||'—'`); only the two *sources* lied — so the fix
is at the sources, no view change. Chose to **omit** the field when unconfigured
(not emit `""`). A compat worry about maw-js parsers turned out moot: the "maw-js
nodes on the LAN" were a mirage — that `mawjs` value *was* the bug #687 killed;
the real nodes are maw-rs. Deliberate maw-js parity divergence: we emit nothing
rather than a plausible guess. A **third** `mawjs` default survives in the signing
path (`maw-auth` `DEFAULT_ORACLE`, #693) — left as a scope decision, not smuggled in.

**#677 / #689 (frozen node/oracle).** The issue's stated root cause — "`peers
probe` never writes back" — is **wrong**, and I proved it live: `maw peers probe`
advanced `lastSeen` on both black and m5. The writer exists and works. The real
gap: the serve federation map **fetches live for display but never persists**, so
`lastSeen` only moves on a manual probe. #689 adds a periodic sweep that persists
through the **one** existing writer (never the render path). Its lost-update race
fix is **reload-before-apply** (snapshot → probe → re-read fresh → write only
probe-owned fields), chosen over a lock file because it's simpler and can't
deadlock; a residual sub-ms window is documented in-code, not hidden.

**#676 (`ls --federation` 404).** `/api/ls` is implemented by **no serve, not even
localhost** — its response shape was *imagined*. The fix retargets the client to
`/api/sessions` (a real, bare-array endpoint), not a new endpoint. The test stub
had to become a bare array to actually guard the `as_array` parse branch — the old
`{sessions:[…]}` stub let you delete that branch with the suite staying green while
every real peer returned empty.

**#672 (notify to wrong inbox).** Scoped to **defect 1 only** (write to the
receiver's `ψ/inbox`, resolved via the registry, not the sender's). Defect 2
(`hey --inbox local:` injects into the pane) needs threading `inbox` through the
audited local send hotpath — bigger, deferred. Help text left **untouched** so it
doesn't advertise `--inbox` as working locally while defect 2 stands.

**#696 (pair generate panic).** `pair_http_json` did `block_on` on a runtime worker
thread → "cannot start a runtime from within a runtime". Fix mirrors
`peers_fetch_identity` (spawn a fresh thread). The panic→`Result` change **also**
fixes store consistency for free: `pair_http_json` runs *before* `pair_write_peer`,
so a clean `Err` means the half-write never happens. It was the **only** unguarded
production `block_on` (swept them all).

## 3. Fleet-structural facts the primary needs

- **Two serve processes on black.** `:3456` (nat, legacy) and `:3458` (maw-rs,
  canonical/systemd) report **different node identities** (`black` vs
  `maw-rs-black`) for the same machine. Validate any remote-durable fix against
  the canonical **:3458**, and make sure fleet registries point there — otherwise
  probes keep hitting the stale `nat`-owned process (a third "frozen identity"
  specimen, this time in *which OS process answers*).
- **Config store split.** Cross-node `hey` resolves the target from
  `maw.config.json → namedPeers`, a **different** store than `peers.json` (which
  the map/`peers` use). A peer can be up + aggregated yet unaddressable by `hey`.
  A **bare-name** `hey` loops back to self and reports success — always use the
  full `node:session:window` form.
- **Reporting channel.** Post via `gh issue/pr comment` — it persists across
  `/clear`; `hey` messages don't. This whole session's reasoning survives because
  it went to gh, not just the pane.
- **`maw pair` writes peer records** (`pair_write_peer`) — treat any failure in
  that flow as store-affecting, return `Result`, never `panic`.

## 3b. Older traps from this instance's memory (repo-relevant, undocumented)

These predate this week but live only in this instance's private memory, so they
vanish with it unless recorded. Each has bitten before.

- **Native vs WASM: settle it by real-invoke, not by reading.** `grep` and even
  careful source-reading both *lied* about whether stream/hub/layout run native or
  via a WASM plugin. Only invoking the verb on a **default (no-`wasm-host`) build**
  settles it — a WASM-routed verb errors `ship-tier WASM plugin` there, a native
  one runs. Don't conclude "this is native" from the call graph; run it.
- **A versioned binary breaks process-name predicates (#520).** For a
  self-updating client, `pane_current_command` is the **version string**
  (e.g. `2.1.207`), not the program name (`claude`). Any predicate keying on the
  process *name* silently matches nothing. Native code was patched to handle this;
  **plugins fossilize the old assumption** — check both when a pane predicate
  "sees nothing."
- **Serve auth is env-or-config, and loopback trusts itself by default.**
  `serve.token` and `loopbackExempt` are **config keys, not CLI flags** (passing
  them as `--flags` silently does nothing). `loopbackExempt` **defaults true** — two
  UIDs on loopback trust each other's signed requests without a token. That is
  why `curl 127.0.0.1:3456` and `:3458` (run **on black itself**) both return 200
  with no credential — it's the loopback exemption, not a broken auth check.
  Matters directly for the two-process (:3456/:3458) setup on black. It does
  **not** explain a LAN host getting the same unauthenticated 200 — #685's
  measurement was taken from a different machine, where the loopback exemption
  cannot apply; that question is still open, see #685's latest comment.
- **Federation wake can report success while doing nothing (#524).** `/api/wake`
  verified the request then returned `ok:true` as a no-op. Never trust a
  **sender-side** "woke it" — verify the **receiver-side effect** (did the pane
  actually change?). Same family as the reachable-vs-fetch and dry-run-vs-send
  traps: a success that doesn't carry proof of the effect can lie.

- **Background work started inside a subagent dies at that subagent's turn-end
  (harness behavior).** A `Bash(run_in_background)` (or any detached process) spawned
  *within* a subagent is orphaned/killed when that subagent's turn ends — it does
  **not** keep running to feed a later step. So a subagent result that says "build
  running / waiting on X / gate in progress" means the work is **incomplete**, not
  pending — treat it as a failure to finish, not a promise to check back. Run long
  gates/builds in the lead session (which persists across turns), not inside a
  spawned subagent. This one is invisible until a "waiting" result quietly never
  resolves.

## 3c. Operating norms the primary inherits (not in any doc, they're Nat's rules)

- **Report back every time, not just when done.** Report to the fleet lead
  (`m5:33-maw-rs:maw-rs`) on: done / stuck / a decision that diverges from what was
  agreed / cut a release / before `/clear`. On "done": the PR link, the 4-dim gate
  result with the **failing test names** (never a count), and a one-line root cause.
  Nat having to ask "are you done yet?" is the smell of unreported progress. Use
  `gh` comments — they persist across `/clear`; `hey` messages don't.
- **Ask without blocking.** When you'd stall on a picker or a question, send the
  QUESTION via `hey` to the lead **and proceed on your best recommendation** — do
  not freeze the loop waiting. The coder owns the loop; the lead course-corrects
  after. (This whole session ran that way because the human's composer input kept
  not reaching the pane — decisions came via the m5 relay, and work continued.)
- **Config: don't debug by reading files — ask the tool.** A **no-NN**
  `maw.config.json` is silently ignored once *any* NN layer (`maw.config.50.json`,
  etc.) exists. If a value "isn't taking," run `maw config explain <key>`: it shows
  every layer, which one wins, and (since #623) tags shadowed project layers
  `[SHADOWED]`. The file having your value proves nothing about the runtime value.
- **`hey` and the shell `$`.** Double-quoted `maw hey "…$VAR…"` lets *your* shell
  expand `$VAR` before it's sent. Single-quote to send literally.

## 4. The meta-lesson (the one worth keeping)

Both this instance and m5 **misdiagnosed twice each** this week, and both
self-corrected — every time by **real-invoke on the shipped artifact**, never by
re-reading the issue's stated cause. An issue's "likely cause" is a hypothesis, not
a fact; the codebase at the moment you touch it is the authority. When two
independent instances reach the same wrong conclusion, that's the "context is full"
signal — checkpoint, don't push. See `docs/principles/results-that-match-reality.md`
for the long form; this is the operational corollary: **verify done by running it,
distrust confident labels next to empty results, and write down what you learned
before the fork forgets it.**
